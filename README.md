# Customer Churn Prediction Using SVM, Random Forest, and CNN
<p align="justify">In this repository, I want to show you how to build machine larning model for prediction customer churn using SVM, RF, and CNN. I also want to prove that Deep Learning does not always provide the best accuracy for classification model. What will you get in the code</p>
<ul>
  <li>How to handle categorical dataset</li>
  <li>How to handle imbalanced dataset</li>
  <li>GridSearchCV</li>
  <li>Set inputs and targets data for Deep Learning</li>
 </ul>

**How to run the project:**
<ol>
  <li>Install the library</li>
  <li>Make sure you have load the data on data folder</li>
  <li>Run the code by clik shift+enter</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: GridSearchCV need more time to run</p>
